# Mongomaker

Tool I built for quickly getting a MongoDB database set up for new projects. It takes a configuration spec written in JSON to produce an install file written in Javascript that would set up the collections and indeces in a database.

The Javascript installation file could be executed using NodeJS - this proved useful for the company I used to work at before we started using NextJS and other more complex frameworks that had seeding functionality built-in.
